# Description
Online auction web site with ASP.NET Core. We provide a suite of C# APIs backed by a simple SqLite data store, against a (soon-to-be) frontend layer using basic HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery to pull from these APIs.

No React & friends to be found here (yet?), this is just a basic incarnation of a modern web app structure.

# Todo list
* [ ] Set Up CI pipeline with azure
	* [ ] Configure live demo url in github.
* [ ] Do prototype html/js interface, pulling data from API calls using JQuery calls.
* [ ] Add xunit tests for api interfaces - checking whether the rows etc. were created or not.
